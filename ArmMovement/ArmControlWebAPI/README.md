## The Web Serial API
**A serial port is a bidirectional communication interface that allows sending and receiving data byte by byte.
The Web Serial API provides a way for websites to read from and write to a serial device with JavaScript. Serial devices are connected either through a serial port on the user's system or through removable USB and Bluetooth devices that emulate a serial port.
In other words, the Web Serial API bridges the web and the physical world by allowing websites to communicate with serial devices, such as microcontrollers and 3D printers.**
